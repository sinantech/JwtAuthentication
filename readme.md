# JWT Authentication and Authorization in a Spring Boot Application

## Introduction

JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is a popular method for securing web applications by generating tokens that contain encrypted user information. In a Spring Boot application, JWT authentication and authorization can be implemented to control access to different endpoints based on the user's role.

## Authentication Process

- **User Authentication**: When a user logs in with their credentials, the server validates the username and password. If the credentials are correct, the server generates a JWT token.

- **Token Generation**: The server generates a JWT token containing the user's information (such as username and roles) and signs it with a secret key.

- **Token Response**: The server sends the JWT token back to the client as a response to the authentication request.

## Authorization Process

- **Token Validation**: For each subsequent request to protected endpoints, the client includes the JWT token in the request header.

- **Token Verification**: The server verifies the JWT token's signature and decodes it to extract the user's information.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Based on the user's roles extracted from the JWT token, the server determines whether the user has access to the requested endpoint.

- **Access Control**: If the user's role grants access to the endpoint, the server processes the request; otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized error.

## Conclusion

JWT authentication and authorization provide a robust method for securing Spring Boot applications by allowing role-based access control to endpoints. By implementing JWT, developers can ensure secure communication between clients and servers while maintaining scalability and flexibility in their applications.
